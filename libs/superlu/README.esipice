This version of SuperLU has been modified for use in eispice. There are two
primary patches (found in this directory). One patch fixes a bug that was
causing seg faults when malformed matricies were passed to SuperLU. The other
patch improves the library's performance. The Makefiles have also been 
re-written to better fit with the eispice build process, and all unused 
source files were removed to reduce the size of the source code.
