This is the reference implementation of a BLAS from netlib downloaded 03-17-07.
If you want to improve pefromance you could use your own machine tuned BLAS
(like ATLAS) instead though you may not see a huge performance boost, it will
depend on the type of circuit you are simulating.

A Makefile for eispice was added, and all of the files, except those used
by eispice have been removed.
