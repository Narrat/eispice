"""
eispice is a clone of the Berkley Spice 3 Simulation Engine. It was 
originally targeted toward PCB level Signal Integrity Simulation; simulating 
IBIS model defined devices, transmission lines, and passive termination but 
the scope of the tool has been slowly expanding to include more general 
purpose circuit simulation features.

For more information refer to the eispice webpage:
<www.thedigitalmachine.net/eispice>

Please report all bugs to:
<charles@thedigitalmachine.net>

Classes:
Circuit -- an eispice circuit

Functions:
about -- prints info on eispice and it's libraries
logFile -- records the eispice log to the specified file instead of stdout
errFile -- records the eispice error log to the specified file instead of stderr

Modules:
device -- basic device library
ibis -- support for ibis defined models
plot -- simple, default plot utility
subckt -- provides sub-circuit support
waveform -- provides wavefroms that can be used in sources
test -- the eispice test framework
