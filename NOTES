New since last release:
- Added locking mechanism to list execute function
- Migrated to Fortran95 from Fortran77
	
TODO Before next major release:
- Finish W-Element model
- Add a digital control to the VI Device to support controlling IBIS Drivers

Long Term ToDo:
- Add coupled inductor model
- Add all missing Spice3 models to become Spice 3f5 equivelant
- Add Ferrite Bead Model
- Add non-liner inductor model
- Integrate a 2D feild solver (MMTL)
- Add remaining semi-conductor models required to become Spice 3f5 equivelant
- Finish the the netlist / auto-tool
- Add an interface for PyB devices to read from the simulator's history.
- Is there a more memory friendly way to pass the results back to Python?
- Clean up the error messages, add Pythonic error message display
- Improve the break-point checking algorithum (make it more robust)
-- what about doing bp check in the inductor and capacitor devices instead
	of globaly...
- Add options control
- Add device definition helper tools (like Thomas suggested)
- Improve the Python Defined Behaiverial Model
-- Add a ddt operator to make it more compliant with Verlig-AMS
-- Improve the performance by minimizing the number of operations per call-back
- Take a closer look at performance, what can be done to improve it?
- Build a Verilog/VHDL interface
- Improve the plotter
-- eye diagrams
-- zoom
-- resize window
-- print
-- save to file
-- improve performance
- Add Layout import (gerber files or something general like that)
- Add S-Paramter Model Support
- Add Initial Conditions Support (if required)
- Add post-processors, (Over-Shoot, Non-Monotonic Checks, etc...)
- Improve Documentation
